## Game features

The game will have a start menu, and end menu. The start menu will allow the player to start up the game, and the end menu will be prompted once the player finishes the game. While the player are inside the game, they can use the standard arrows key to control directions of the character, and space bar for jumping. The game also includes a collection feature that will display how many collectables the players collected on the top left of the screen. 

## Notes

The game is slightly different than the game pitch as I made some changes for a better player experience, however the theme are fairly inline with the initial game pitch still. The controls I have decided to include horizontal movement instead of the initial jump only movement. As I feel like with vertical and horizontal movement the game allows more freedom for the player control and the game is still within the same theme.

I have also went above and beyond instead of just a horizontal slice, I have added the details additional to the horizontal slice required for the assignment to make the game feel more alive and fun to play as the player. I love games and this assignment had allow me to learn some hands on game development process with Unity, I really enjoyed it and wanted to make it as complete as I can instead of a simple horizontal slice.
